## Next Priority Features

Based on our roadmap, the following features should be prioritized next:

1. **Turn-by-Turn Directions with Audio Prompts**
   - Implement voice navigation for walking tours
   - Create audio direction system
   - Develop offline voice guidance

2. **Augmented Reality Points of Interest**
   - Implement AR view for landmarks
   - Create historical overlays for sites
   - Develop interactive AR experiences

3. **Heat Maps for Popular Attractions**
   - Implement crowd density visualization
   - Create time-based popularity metrics
   - Develop optimal visiting time recommendations

4. **Group Booking Discounts**
   - Implement tiered pricing for group sizes
   - Create group management features
   - Develop group coordinator tools

## Timeline for Next Features

| Feature | Estimated Duration | Suggested Start |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Turn-by-Turn Directions | 3-4 weeks | Immediate |
| AR Points of Interest | 4-6 weeks | Parallel with Turn-by-Turn |
| Heat Maps | 2-3 weeks | After Turn-by-Turn Directions |
| Group Booking Discounts | 2-3 weeks | After Heat Maps |

## Resource Allocation

To complete these features efficiently, we recommend the following resource allocation:

- **Backend Development**: 2 developers
- **Frontend Development**: 2 developers
- **Mobile Development**: 1 dedicated developer
- **QA Testing**: 1 tester
- **AR/3D Specialist**: 1 developer (for AR features)

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **AR Feature Complexity**
   - Risk: Technical challenges with AR implementation across devices
   - Mitigation: Start with basic AR features, progressive enhancement approach

2. **Third-Party API Dependencies**
   - Risk: Reliance on external bike rental APIs
   - Mitigation: Create adapter pattern for multiple providers, implement fallbacks

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Risk: Resource-intensive features impacting app performance
   - Mitigation: Implement lazy loading, optimize assets, conduct regular performance testing

## Conclusion

The TourGuide project is making excellent progress, with 91% of planned features now complete. The recent implementation of server-side rendering, accessibility improvements, GPS-triggered audio commentary, real-time bus tracking, QR code ticket generation, mobile app development, security enhancements, bike rental integration, and route elevation profiles has significantly transformed the platform into a comprehensive tourism solution.

The next phase will focus on advanced navigation capabilities, augmented reality experiences, and enhanced booking features to further improve the user experience and differentiate our platform in the market. With these final features implemented, the TourGuide application will be ready for full production deployment and market launch.

The project is on track to be completed within the next 2-3 months, with a phased rollout strategy to ensure a smooth launch and positive user experience.
