# Real-Time Bus Tracking Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement real-time bus tracking for bus tours in the TourGuide application. This feature will enhance the user experience by providing live location updates, estimated arrival times, and notifications for bus tours.

The real-time bus tracking feature will:

1. Display live locations of tour buses on interactive maps
2. Provide estimated arrival times for upcoming stops
3. Send notifications when buses are approaching user's location
4. Show bus capacity and occupancy information
5. Visualize bus routes with progress indicators
6. Support offline viewing of scheduled routes and times
