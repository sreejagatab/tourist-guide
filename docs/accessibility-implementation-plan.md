# Accessibility Implementation Plan (WCAG 2.1 Compliance)

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement WCAG 2.1 compliance for the TourGuide application. Accessibility is a critical aspect of our application to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use our platform.

## Current Status

The application already has some accessibility features implemented:
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast mode
- ARIA attributes

However, a comprehensive audit and implementation of WCAG 2.1 guidelines is needed to ensure full compliance.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audit and Assessment (1-2 weeks)

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Run automated accessibility tools (Axe, Lighthouse, WAVE)
   - Generate reports for each critical page
   - Categorize issues by severity and type

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Color contrast verification
   - Focus management review

3. **User Testing**
   - Recruit users with disabilities for testing sessions
   - Collect feedback on usability issues
   - Document pain points and barriers

### Phase 2: Implementation (3-4 weeks)

1. **Semantic HTML Structure**
   - Review and update HTML structure for proper semantics
   - Ensure correct heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Implement proper landmark regions (header, main, nav, footer)

2. **Keyboard Accessibility**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Implement visible focus indicators
   - Create logical tab order
   - Add skip links for navigation

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Add descriptive alt text for all images
   - Implement ARIA roles, states, and properties
   - Ensure form fields have proper labels
   - Add descriptions for complex UI components

4. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Make text resizable without breaking layout
   - Implement responsive design for zoom support
   - Ensure content is distinguishable without relying on color alone

5. **Form Accessibility**
   - Add clear error messages and validation
   - Implement autocomplete attributes
   - Ensure form controls have associated labels
   - Group related form elements with fieldset and legend

6. **Dynamic Content**
   - Implement ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
   - Ensure modals and dialogs are accessible
   - Add appropriate focus management for interactive components
   - Implement proper error handling and notifications

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Automated Retesting**
   - Run automated tools to verify improvements
   - Compare before/after metrics
   - Address any remaining automated issues

2. **Manual Verification**
   - Test with screen readers on different browsers
   - Verify keyboard navigation flows
   - Check focus management in complex interactions

3. **User Validation**
   - Conduct follow-up testing with users with disabilities
   - Collect feedback on improvements
   - Identify any remaining barriers

4. **Documentation**
   - Create accessibility statement
   - Document known issues and workarounds
   - Provide accessibility features documentation for users

## WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria Focus

We will focus on meeting the following WCAG 2.1 Level AA success criteria:

### Perceivable
- 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Alt text for images)
- 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Semantic structure)
- 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Logical reading order)
- 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Instructions not dependent on shape, color, etc.)
- 1.3.4 Orientation (Content not restricted to specific orientation)
- 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (Form field purpose is clear)
- 1.4.1 Use of Color (Color not sole means of conveying information)
- 1.4.2 Audio Control (Audio can be paused, stopped)
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- 1.4.4 Resize Text (Text can be resized up to 200%)
- 1.4.5 Images of Text (Avoid using images of text)
- 1.4.10 Reflow (Content viewable without scrolling in two dimensions)
- 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (UI components have sufficient contrast)
- 1.4.12 Text Spacing (No loss of content with increased text spacing)
- 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (Additional content revealed on hover/focus is dismissible)

### Operable
- 2.1.1 Keyboard (All functionality available from keyboard)
- 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Focus can be moved away using keyboard)
- 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Shortcuts can be turned off or remapped)
- 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Time limits can be adjusted)
- 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Moving content can be paused)
- 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below (No content flashes more than three times per second)
- 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Skip links provided)
- 2.4.2 Page Titled (Pages have descriptive titles)
- 2.4.3 Focus Order (Focus order preserves meaning)
- 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Link purpose is clear from text)
- 2.4.5 Multiple Ways (Multiple ways to find pages)
- 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Descriptive headings and labels)
- 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Keyboard focus is visible)
- 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (Complex gestures have alternatives)
- 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (Actions completed on up-event)
- 2.5.3 Label in Name (Visible label matches accessible name)
- 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (Functionality triggered by motion can be disabled)

### Understandable
- 3.1.1 Language of Page (Page language is specified)
