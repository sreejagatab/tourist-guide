TourGuide: A Comprehensive Tourism App
Architecture Overview
To create a consistent experience across web, iOS, and Android, I recommend a cross-platform approach with shared business logic and platform-specific UI implementations.
Core Technology Stack

✅ Backend: Node.js with Express for API services
✅ Database: MongoDB for flexible document storage
✅ Authentication: OAuth/JWT for secure user sessions
✅ Payment Processing: Stripe API integration
✅ Maps: Google Maps API with custom overlays
⬜ Mobile: React Native for iOS/Android with native modules where needed
✅ Web: React.js for responsive web interface

Key Features Implementation
User-Friendly Interface
I'll design an intuitive interface with consistent navigation patterns across platforms while respecting platform-specific design guidelines:

⬜ Mobile-First Approach: Optimized for on-the-go usage with thumb-friendly zones
✅ Responsive Web Design: Adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile browsers
✅ Consistent Design Language: Shared color scheme, typography, and iconography
⬜ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive usage
